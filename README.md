# ðŸ§  LLaMA 3 Sentiment Analysis with LoRA Fine-Tuning

This repository demonstrates how to fine-tune **Meta LLaMA 3.2 1B** or any**LLM** for **sentiment analysis** or any **supervised task**using **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)** and ** quantization** for memory efficiency.  
The project is implemented in Python using **Hugging Face Transformers**, **PEFT**, **BitsAndBytes**, and **PyTorch**.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project fine-tunes a quantized LLaMA model on sentiment classification data (positive, negative, neutral).  
The fine-tuning is lightweight and efficient â€” ideal for consumer GPUs â€” and demonstrates how large language models can be adapted for downstream NLP tasks like text sentiment classification.
